# Fetching Feature

## Requirements
I would like to implement a fetching feature like the one that is implemented in nextjs wiht the specification here https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch. I would like it to be implemented in the @src/fetching service folder. In the providers section I would like you to implement the fetching service using an axios provider in the file src/fetching/providers/fetchingaxios.js and a provider using native nodes js in a file called src/fetching/providers/fetchingnode.js. Please ensure that I can select which one I want to use when calling ghe src/fetching/index.js file. Please look at an example in src/caching to see how this is achieved. In the @src/fetching/routes folder please enable that I can call this service using api's and provide a status endpoint as well as can be seen in the src/caching/routes folder. Please ensure clear use of event emitter logic to indicate when data is cache refreshed etc. Please ensure that analytics data is capture in a src/fetching/modules/analytics.js file and made available in a route. Please review closely the full folder structure of src/caching to understand how to build a service and adapt it to this fetching service.
