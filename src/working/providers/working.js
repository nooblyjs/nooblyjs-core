/**
 * @fileoverview Production worker manager.
 *
 * Owns a pool of `worker_threads` Workers and dispatches queued tasks to
 * them. Tasks are persisted in three named queues from the injected queueing
 * service so the lifecycle is observable from outside the process:
 *
 *   - `nooblyjs-core-working-incoming` — tasks waiting to start
 *   - `nooblyjs-core-working-complete` — finished successfully
 *   - `nooblyjs-core-working-error`    — finished in error
 *
 * Behaviour is governed by three settings, each enforced at runtime:
 *
 *   - `workerTimeout` — wall-clock budget per task in ms; an exceeded task is
 *     terminated, recorded as an error, and the worker slot freed.
 *   - `maxQueueSize`  — refuses new `start()` calls when the incoming queue
 *     is at the cap, returning a structured error rather than silently
 *     growing memory.
 *   - `enableLogging` — gates the structured logger calls so high-volume
 *     deployments can opt out of per-task log lines.
 *
 * The queue processor is a 1-second interval that is `unref()`'d so it does
 * not keep the Node event loop alive on its own — long-running services
 * still tick, but unit tests and short-lived scripts exit cleanly.
 *
 * COMPLETION IS CORRELATED BY TASK ID, NOT CARRIED ON THE QUEUE. Everything
 * enqueued here must survive a JSON round trip, because the queueing service may
 * be out of process: the ActiveMQ provider enqueues with `JSON.stringify` and
 * dequeues with `JSON.parse`. A caller's `completionCallback` is therefore kept
 * in `pendingCallbacks_` on the process that called `start()`, and the task
 * carries only an `origin` stamp naming that process. Two paths settle it:
 *
 *   - LOCAL — the process that queued the task also ran it (always so for the
 *     in-memory provider). `finaliseTask_` fires the callback directly, with no
 *     broker round trip.
 *   - REMOTE — another process ran it and wrote the result to the shared
 *     complete/error queue. `processResults_` drains those queues and matches
 *     results to the waiters this process holds; results belonging to a sibling
 *     are put back for it, up to `MAX_RESULT_ROUTING_ATTEMPTS`.
 *
 * Every waiter has a deadline (`callbackTimeout`), so a task whose result never
 * arrives fails loudly instead of leaving the caller awaiting a promise that can
 * never settle. This matters because the callback is the ONLY way a workflow
 * step advances — `WorkflowService` awaits a promise that resolves nowhere else.
 * Before this, putting the function on the queue meant it was silently dropped
 * by JSON and every workflow hung after its first step.
